# ⚠️ URGENT: FIX YOUR VERCEL ERROR NOW

## 🔴 Your Error:

```
Error: PrismaConfigEnvError: Missing required environment variable: DATABASE_URL
```

## ✅ The Fix (3 Steps - 5 Minutes):

### 1. Get Free Database (2 min)
→ Go to **[neon.tech](https://neon.tech)**
→ Sign up FREE
→ Create project
→ Copy connection string

### 2. Set on Vercel (2 min)
→ Go to **Vercel Dashboard**
→ Your Project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
→ Add these **3 variables** for **ALL environments**:

```
DATABASE_URL = your-neon-connection-string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = [run: openssl rand -base64 32]
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**IMPORTANT:** Check the boxes for Production, Preview, AND Development!

### 3. Redeploy (30 sec)
→ Push code again OR click "Redeploy" in Vercel

---

## 🎯 Why This Failed

You tried to deploy **without** setting environment variables first.

Vercel needs `DATABASE_URL` during the build process, but you haven't set it yet.

---

## ✅ After Variables Are Set

1. Deployment will succeed
2. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
3. Test your app
4. Done! ✅
